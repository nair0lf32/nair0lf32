### A med student from :benin: who also codes (terribly)

I am a "self-taught", developer and software engineer **wannabe** with a decent grasp of multiple programming languages (Python, Dart/flutter, Javascript, PHP, Java/Kotlin and looking forward to learn Golang and Rust). Currently learning but planning to someday contribute to the development of solid solutions for some world's major problems (Healthcare sector mostly).

I am also a very bad CTF player passionate about cybersecurity and worst coding practices
