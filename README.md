## That Med student who also code (somehow)

I am a "self-taught" developer, and software engineer **wannabe** with a decent understanding of multiple web and software development concepts fiddling with some common programming languages like Python, Dart/flutter, Javascript, PHP, Java/Kotlin and looking forward to learn Golang and Rust. I am currently just learning and having fun trying to contribute to the development of awesome solutions for some of the world's silliest problems. I am also a very bad CTF player, passionate about cybersecurity and worst coding practices. I also happen to enjoy video games and silly memes ^_^
