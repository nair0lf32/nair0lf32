# Hi👾 I am nair0lf32

👨🏿‍💻 Medical Student | Self-Taught Full-Stack & Cross-Platform Dev | CTF Player | Indie Haxxor

Hi, I'm *EDEMESSI Florian* — a curious guy from 🇧🇯 with a decent understanding of software development paradigms.

I tinker with ~~too~~ many programming languages, often breaking things, but always learning something new in the process. I'm mostly here to have fun and **[contribute](https://ossrank.com/c/46498)** to solving some of the world’s silliest problems (especially in healthcare). I’m also a terrible CTF player, cybersecurity enthusiast, and a devoted practitioner of the worst coding practices imaginable.

I also like videogames, silly memes, and long debugging hours

Welcome to my GitHub — where the spaghetti code lies and chaos reigns. May you find something useful, or at least mildly entertaining.🍝

Most (if not all) of my social links are available on my **[About me](https://about.me/florian_edemessi)** page. If you ever wanna get in touch with me. I recommend using mostly **Email, WhatsApp or Discord** to reach me faster, as I check those more often, but feel free to use any available link you want.

*Feel free to check my pinned repositories for more details about my **main** projects*
