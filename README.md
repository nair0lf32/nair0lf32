# Greetings ðŸ‘¾, I am Florian EDEMESSI

Another one of those "self-taught" developers and software "engineers" **wannabe** with some vague and imprecise understanding of web/software development concepts and paradigms, fiddling with many programming languages at once, learning some things on the way and breaking more. I am mostly trying to have fun and [contribute](https://ossrank.com/c/46498) to the development of solutions for some of the world's silliest problems. Also I happen to be a terrible CTF player, passionate about cybersecurity and the worst coding practices imaginable. I also like Video games and silly memes (^_^) Welcome to my personal GitHub, where I put the spaghetti code and stuff. May you ever find something you like

Most (if not all) of my social links are available on my [about.me](https://about.me/florian_edemessi) page if you ever wanna get in touch. I recommend using mostly email, whatsApp or discord to reach me faster, as I check those more often, but feel free to use any available link you want. *Feel free to check my pinned repositories for more details about my **main** projects*
