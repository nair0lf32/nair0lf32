# Hi👾, I am nair0lf32

**Medical Doctor | Self-Taught Full-Stack & Cross-Platform Dev | CTF Player | Indie Haxxor** 👨🏿‍💻

Hi, I’m EDEMESSI Florian Eudes (nairolf32), A curious mind from 🇧🇯 and an unusual but effective mix of medical doctor and self-taught developer. I work at the intersection of healthcare and technology, with interests in software engineering and cybersecurity. I enjoy experimenting, breaking things, and fixing them when necessary, aiming to build meaningful solutions, especially in healthcare. When I’m not coding, I’m probably gaming, laughing at bad memes, or stuck in a long debugging session. Welcome to my GitHub, where chaos, spaghetti code, and the occasional useful project coexist.

Most (if not all) of my social links are available on my **[About me](https://about.me/florian_edemessi)** page. If you ever wanna get in touch with me. I recommend using mostly **Email, WhatsApp or Discord** to reach me faster, as I check those more often, but feel free to use any available link you want.

*Feel free to check my pinned repositories for more details about my current **main** projects*
