# Hi ðŸ‘¾, I'm Florian EDEMESSI

A Med student who codes (somehow). I am a "self-taught" developer and software engineer **wannabe** with a decent understanding of web/software development most important concepts, fiddling with many programming languages at once (mostly C, Python, and Javascript) always learning new things (Golang and Rust currently). I am mostly trying to have fun and in the meantime, contribute to the development of awesome solutions for some of the world's silliest problems. I am also a terrible CTF player, passionate about cybersecurity and worst coding practices imaginable. I also happen to enjoy video games and silly memes (^_^) Welcome to my personal GitHub, where I put terrible spaghetti code and stuff. May you ever find something you like
