# Tech

Random list of links for tools, services and utilities I use

# Domains

I happen to own domains with [namecheap](https://namecheap.com) and [.tech](https://get.tech) registrars. I also use multiple free subdomains wherever I can get them. I manage some from [here](http://freedns.afraid.org/domain/)


# Cloud and Vps

I use mostly [akamai/linode](https://cloud.linode.com) (tested [digitalocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/) too) for my VPS as they are cheaper and more beginner-friendly than google, azure, aws...
