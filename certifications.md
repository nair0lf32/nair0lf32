# Certifications

I am not very found of the idea that certificates are a good skill indicator  
or even absolute proof of experience, especially when they are free, But i think  
they can be useful to quickly showcase what someone acomplished or did.

I just want to keep a track of my certifications links here (most are free):

## Coding/IT

## Cybersecurity
