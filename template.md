# Hi ðŸ‘¾, I'm Florian EDEMESSI

A Med student who codes (somehow). I am a "self-taught" developer and software engineer **wannabe** with a decent understanding of web/software development most important concepts, fiddling with many programming languages at once (mostly C, Python, and Javascript) always learning new things (Golang and Rust currently). I am mostly trying to have fun and in the meantime, contribute to the development of awesome solutions for some of the world's silliest problems. I am also a terrible CTF player, passionate about cybersecurity and worst coding practices imaginable. I also happen to enjoy video games and silly memes (^_^)

Welcome to my personal GitHub, where I put terrible spaghetti code and stuff. May you ever find something you like

**{{ Math.round(REGISTERED_YEARS) }}** years ago I joined GitHub on **{{ f.date(REGISTRATION_DATE, {date:true}) }}**, and so far, I contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** repositories, with just **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** repositories created by me. I got **{{ STARGAZERS }}** nice stargazers, and starred **{{ STARRED }}** repositories myself, made **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, joined **{{ ORGANIZATIONS }}** organizations, made **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, got involved into **{{ ISSUES }}** issues. I am following **{{ FOLLOWING }}** great inspiring people and got **{{ FOLLOWERS }}** great ones behind me too, to which I am very thankful ðŸ’›. I use a lot of coding languages and tools but my favorite ones are:
