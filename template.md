## That med student who thinks he can also code (somehow)

I am a "self-taught", developer, software engineer **wannabe** with a decent grasp of multiple programming languages (Python, Dart/flutter, Javascript, PHP, Java/Kotlin and looking forward to learn Golang and Rust). Currently learning but planning to someday contribute to the development of solutions for some of world's major problems (Healthcare sector mostly).
I am also a very bad CTF player, passionate about cybersecurity and worst coding practices.

(I also happen to enjoy videogames and silly memes ^_^)

Welcome to my personal GitHub. Here I put terrible spaghetti code and stuff. May you ever find something you like here.
